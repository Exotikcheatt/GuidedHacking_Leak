Game Hacking Fundamentals is a physical game hacking book brought to you by @Erarnitox
 & Guided Hacking. This book is 270 pages long and will teach you 
everything from beginning to end, from using Cheat Engine all the way to
 making a fully featured aimbot and ESP!

Game Hacking Fundamentals was created in the same vein as the 
Game Hacking Bible, it's meant to be one stop shopping for learning how 
to hack games. Everything you need to learn how to hack games from A to Z
 is covered in depth. There are so many pitfalls and confusing aspects 
to learning this craft, the purpose of the book is to make learning as 
easy as possible and limit much of the frustration that was once common 
place. Why limit yourself to just one resource when learning? Armed with
 the our Bible and this new book, your potential is limitless. The GHB 
is a fantastic digital resource for learning but the Game Hacking 
Fundamentals book offers you a physical copy which you can read on the 
bus, at your desk or in bed. Watching hours of videos might not be for 
you, which is why we highly recommend this book, we do have hundreds of 
hours of video content after all.


Treat this new game hacking book as a companion guide to the GHB or vice versa. Don't forget, @Erarnitox
 learned most of what he knows from Guided Hacking, the same things that
 made GH a successful way to learn, will of course be present in Game 
Hacking Fundamentals. Writing tutorials from the perspective of someone 
who just learned how to hack games will no doubt produce the most 
beginner friendly approach to the topic. Easy to read, relatively simple
 for a beginners, filled with many tips, tricks & source codes, this
 book is sure to make your learning progress a breeze. Learning from 
multiple people such as Erarnitox and myself is a great way to get the 
full picture. We all have our little idiosyncrasies and biases, but by 
combining the best knowledge and teachings from both of us you are 
almost guaranteed success.
